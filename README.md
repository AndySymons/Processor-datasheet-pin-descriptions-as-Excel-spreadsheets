# Processor datasheet pin descriptions as Excel worksheets

Have you ever wished processor manufacturers would issue their pin descriptiion tables as Excel spreadsheets? That would make it a lot easier to analyse possibilities when selecting a processor or assigning pins for a new project! 
Well, I wanted this enough to do it myself. This repository is to share the fruits of my labours. I hope you find it useful too. 

### ESP32
The first one published is for the "ESP32 Series" datasheet, which means ESP32-D0xxx, ESP32-S0xxx, and ESP32-S0U4xxx. 
It is transcribed from Espressif Systems version 4.5 (2024). 

I am working on a separate one for ESP32-S2.
